/**
 * --> Generics mean parameterized types.
 * --> The Java Generics programming is introduced in J2SE 5 to deal with type-safe objects.
 * --> The idea is to allow type (Integer, String, â€¦ etc, and user-defined types) to be a parameter to methods, classes, and interfaces.
 * --> Using Generics, it is possible to create classes that work with different data types.
 * --> It makes the code stable by detecting the bugs at compile time.
 * --> Before generics, we can store any type of objects in the collection, i.e., non-generic. Now generics force the
 * java programmer to store a specific type of objects.
 * --> Generics define in Angular brackets - <>
 * <p>
 * ::Advantages of Generics::
 * 1) Type-safety: We can hold only a single type of objects in generics. It doesn't allow to store other objects.
 * 2) Type casting is not require: There is no need to typecast the object.
 * 3) Compile time checking:  It is checked at compile time so problem will not occur at runtime. The good programming
 * strategy says it is far better to handle the problem at compile time than runtime.
